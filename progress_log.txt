PROGRESS LOG:

7.3.2024 (past 2-3weeks):
  Added classes:
    related to 3D (mostly copied and modified from the 2D classes):
      -Boid3D
      -CoordinateReader3D
      -Grid3D
      -Matrix
      -RotationMatrix3D
      -SteeringBehaviour3D
      -Triangle
      -Vector3D
    related to GUI:
      -canvasScene3D
      -MainMenu

  tested functions/classes:
    - 4x4matrix multiplication
    - vector matrix multiplicaton

    other functions/classes have been tested with println statements and manual GUI testing

  in progress:
    proper 3D implementation
      - drawing objects from obj files to the grid
      - moving the camera in the grid
      - being able to look around with the camera

    GUI boids:
      - drawing the boids properly to the screen

    GUI sliders & menus
      - changing the steeringbehaviour values with the sliders
      - changing the simulations settings from a settings tab (not implemented):
        - amount of boids
        - boids max speed
        - etc.

21.3
  fixed functionality:
    -2D/3D timers are now stopped/started when switching the mode (between 2D/3D)
    -sliders now work in 3D

  added functionality:
    -sliders in 2D (changing the steeringbehaviour values with the sliders)

16.4
  added/fixed functionality:
    - rotation for the camera
    - perspective projection
    - camera matrix
    - json presets
    - sliders and labels
    - threading
